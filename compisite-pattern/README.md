# Composite Pattern

This pattern lets us group operations or tasks to do it in one time. It is good when you want to define a serie of tasks to do specific work over the data.

In this example, we have operations for add a tax or to add a discount. This tasks can be added to the composite to define specific composites for each situation in our platform


## Try it

In your console execute:
```bash
ruby composite-pattern/working-example/example.rb
```
